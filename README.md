# Hack Diversity Fellow Technical Interview: Accessible Route Search and Sorting Challenge

### Overview
This technical challenge assesses your understanding of beginner-level data structures and algorithms with a real-world application focused on accessibility. Youâ€™ll create an algorithm that filters and sorts accessible routes and submit your solution through a RESTful API and GitHub.

---

### Objectives
This exercise evaluates the following key skills:
- **Data Structures**: Use arrays or linked lists.
- **Algorithms**: Implement linear search and a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort).
- **API Interaction**: Retrieve and submit data via a RESTful API.
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub to submit your code with frequent commits.

---

### Language and Requirements

- **Preferred Language**: Complete the challenge in any language youâ€™re comfortable with, as long as it enables you to:
  - Implement linear search and basic sorting algorithms.
  - Interact with RESTful APIs using `GET` and `POST` requests.
  - Use version control with Git and push code to GitHub.

- **Requirements**: Ensure your solution meets the following criteria:
  - Filters accessible routes using linear search.
  - Sorts routes by distance in ascending order using a basic sorting algorithm (bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort).
  - Submits a sorted list of routes to the API as specified.

---

### Preparation and Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Fork the provided repository and clone it locally. If no starter repository is provided, create a new repo for your work.
   - Make frequent commits with meaningful messages and push changes to GitHub to maintain a clear history of your progress.

2. **Time Allocation**
   - This challenge should take 30â€“45 minutes, including implementation, testing, and GitHub submission.

## Starting a New Session

To begin the interview, create a unique session. Follow these steps to initialize your session and retrieve a `session_id`, which you will use for authorization in subsequent API requests.

### Endpoint: `/api/start-session`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Initializes a new session and returns a unique `session_id` required for authentication in subsequent requests.

### Request Body (JSON)
```json
{
    "firstName": "YourFirstName",
    "lastName": "YourLastName"
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Description          |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| firstName | string | Your first name      |
| lastName  | string | Your last name       |

### Response
If the session is created successfully, the response will include a unique `session_id` for use as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for other endpoints.

```json
{
    "session_id": "your-unique-session-id"
}
```

### Example in Postman
1. Select the `POST` method.
2. Enter the URL: `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/start-session`
3. Add the following JSON to the request body:

    ```json
    {
        "firstName": "Jean-Jacques",
        "lastName": "Dessalines"
    }
    ```

4. Send the request.
5. Copy the `session_id` from the response and use it as your Bearer token in the Authorization header for all subsequent API requests.

### Authorization Header Format
Once you have your `session_id`, include it in the Authorization header for all API requests that require authentication.

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <session_id>
```

Replace `<session_id>` with the unique session ID received from the `/api/start-session` endpoint.

---

## The Task

### 1. Retrieve Route Data
- **URL**: `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/navigation/routes`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Authorization**: Include the `session_id` as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

### 2. Algorithm Requirements
- **Filter**: Include only accessible routes from the data.
- **Sort**: Arrange the filtered routes by distance in ascending order using one of the following:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

### 3. Test and Validate
- Retrieve sample data from `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/test/mockRoutes` to test your algorithm.
- Submit test data to `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/test/submit-sorted-routes` to validate your logic (up to 3 attempts available, which do not impact your final submission count).

### 4. Submit Final Routes
- **Final Submission URL**: `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/navigation/sorted_routes`
- **Attempts**: Up to 10 attempts are allowed, each of which is logged for review.

### 5. Completion Status
- **Check Progress**: 
  - **URL**: `https://hackdiversity.xyz/api/navigation/status`
  - **Method**: `GET`
  - This will display your progress, remaining attempts, and feedback on prior submissions.

### Helpful Tips

**Algorithm Hints**  
- **Linear Search**: Traverse the list and filter items based on accessibility status.
- **Sorting**: Use a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort) to order routes by distance.

**Validate Locally Before Using the Test API**  
- Build simple test cases locally to check your filtering and sorting logic before using the test API. Testing locally helps catch issues early, reducing the need for multiple API attempts.

**Read Hints in API Responses for Common Mistakes**  
- Review API responses after submissions for hints on common issues, like routes not sorted correctly or inaccessible routes included in results.

**Focus on Algorithmic Thinking**  
- This exercise assesses your understanding of data structures, filtering, and sorting. Plan and verify your algorithm before submitting.

**Using Postman**  
- **Authorization**: Add a `Bearer <session_id>` token to the Authorization header for all requests.
- **Organize Requests**: Use a Postman collection to organize requests for session setup, retrieving routes, testing, and final submission.

**Version Control and Submission**  
- **Commit Regularly**: Commit your code after completing significant tasks, such as implementing filtering or sorting.
- **Final Submission**: Push all changes to GitHub, with clear commit messages. Ensure your final code is readable and organized.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on the following:

1. **Correctness**
   - Accurately filters accessible routes using linear search.
   - Correctly sorts routes in ascending order by distance.

2. **Code Quality**
   - Code should be organized and easy to read.
   - Proper use of arrays or linked lists for handling route data.

3. **Completion and Submission**
   - The correct sorted list is submitted via the API.
   - Your code is pushed to GitHub with a clear, consistent commit history.

4. **Use of GitHub**
   - Demonstrate proficiency with Git by committing regularly and following a structured workflow.

5. **Efficiency (Bonus)**
   - Minor inefficiencies are acceptable, but a well-optimized solution will score higher.
